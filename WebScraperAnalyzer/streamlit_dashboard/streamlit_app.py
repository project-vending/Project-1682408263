Sure, here is a simple version of a `streamlit_app.py` file for the 'WebScraperAnalyzer' project:

#python
import streamlit as st
import boto3
import pandas as pd


# Create a connection to the S3 bucket
s3 = boto3.client('s3')

# Get the list of bucket names
bucket_list = s3.list_buckets()

# Select the bucket you want to access
bucket_name = st.selectbox("Select a bucket:", [b['Name'] for b in bucket_list['Buckets']])

# Display a list of files in the selected bucket
bucket_files = s3.list_objects(Bucket=bucket_name)['Contents']
selected_file = st.selectbox("Select a file:", [f['Key'] for f in bucket_files])

# Load the selected file into a pandas dataframe
data = pd.read_csv('s3://{}/{}'.format(bucket_name, selected_file))

# Show the content of the loaded file
st.write(data)


This code will allow a user to select an S3 bucket and file, and then display the contents of the selected file in a DataFrame. You can modify this code as per your requirement to make it more suitable for your use-case.
