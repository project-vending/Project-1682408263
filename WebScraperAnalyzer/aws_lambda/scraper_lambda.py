Here is an example Python code for `scraper_lambda.py`. Note that this is just an example and you will need to customize the code to fit your specific scraping needs:

#
import boto3
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    # Retrieve the URL from the Lambda event
    url = event['url']
    
    # Scrape the webpage using requests and BeautifulSoup
    response = requests.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, "html.parser")
    
    # Extract your desired data from the webpage using BeautifulSoup
    data = []
    for tag in soup.find_all('tag_name'):
        data.append(tag.text.strip())
    
    # Save the scraped data to S3
    s3 = boto3.client('s3')
    bucket_name = 'your_bucket_name'
    key = 'raw_data.csv'
    s3.put_object(Bucket=bucket_name, Key=key, Body='\n'.join(data))
    
    return "Webpage data scraped and saved to S3"


This code is just a skeleton and you'll need to fill in the details based on the requirements of your project. In particular, you'll need to replace `'tag_name'` in the loop with the appropriate HTML tag name for the data you want to scrape, and you'll need to replace `'your_bucket_name'` with the name of the S3 bucket where you want to store your scraped data. Finally, remember to grant your Lambda function the necessary permissions to read and write to your S3 bucket.
